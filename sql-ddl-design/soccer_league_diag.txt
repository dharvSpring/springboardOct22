# Part Three: Soccer League
# Design a schema for a simple sports league. Your schema should keep track of

# All of the teams in the league
# All of the goals scored by every player for each game
# All of the players in the league and their corresponding teams
# All of the referees who have been part of each game
# All of the matches played between teams
# All of the start and end dates for season that a league has
# The standings/rankings of each team in the league
#   (This doesnâ€™t have to be its own table if the data can be captured somehow).
